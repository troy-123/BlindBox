# BlockChain BlindBox

### Problem statement

In the real world, blind boxes come in various forms, such as toys, vending machines, and cloth items, I am interested in creating a virtual blockchain-based blind box.

### Example scenario

Each box is uploaded by individuals from around the world and can contain various types of information, such as videos, images, texts, or interesting files. Before purchasing a box, we can obtain some information about its content, but the exact content remains unknown. After purchasing the blind box, we will discover its content. Additionally, we can utilize a virtual map to keep a record of purchase transactions, such as the locations of the buyers and sellers.
